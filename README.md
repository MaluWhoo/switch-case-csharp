# C# Switch-Case Control Flow Practice

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This repository contains a simple C# console application designed for practicing and understanding the **`switch-case`** conditional control structure. It includes three separate examples demonstrating how `switch` statements can be used to handle different inputs efficiently.

## âœ¨ Features and Learning Goals

The code explores the following use cases for `switch-case`:

1.  **Days of the Week (Commented out):** Maps an integer input (1-7) to the corresponding day of the week.
2.  **Months of the Year (Commented out):** Maps an integer input (1-12) to the corresponding month name, illustrating a more concise syntax.
3.  **Interactive Navigation Menu (Active):** The primary focus, demonstrating how to use `switch-case` to respond to user input in a simple console menu.
    * **Options:** 1 - Register, 2 - List Users, 3 - Delete Users, 4 - Exit.

## ðŸ’¡ Key C# Concepts Practiced

* **`switch-case`:** The main focus, demonstrating its syntax and use for multi-way branching.
* **Console Input/Output:** Using `Console.WriteLine()` and `Console.ReadLine()`.
* **Type Casting:** Converting user input (string) to an integer using `int.Parse()`.
* **`break` statement:** Essential for exiting the `switch` block after a case is executed.
* **`default` case:** Handling invalid or unexpected input.
